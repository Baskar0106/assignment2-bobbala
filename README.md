### Algorithm

>Legendre's formula can be used to prove Kummer's theorem.

> As one special case, it can be used to prove that if n is a positive integer then 4 divides {\displaystyle {\binom {2n}{n}}}{\binom  {2n}{n}} if and only if n is not a power of 2.

>It follows from Legendre's formula that the p-adic exponential function has radius of convergence {\displaystyle p^{-1/(p-1)}}p^{{-1/(p-1)}}.

```
int fact_pow (int n, int k) {
    int res = 0;
    while (n) {
        n /= k;
        res += n;
    }
    return res;
}
